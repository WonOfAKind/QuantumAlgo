# QuantumAlgo
A Repo where I try and make Quantum Computing Practical :)

(And also try to become a decent Quantum Software Engineer or and Quantum ML/DL Engineer)

## Notes
* All aspects of my code (except for the files in the setup directory) will utilize quantum computing in some shape or form.

* For a majority of my projects, IBM's Qiskit will be used to set up these quantum computations alongside pennylane. 

* If you want to see what packages to install, please refer to requirments.txt. 

* Since Quantum Computing itself is still pretty new and evolving rapidly, some of my code may be outdated within months, but i'll try my best to update it.
* Because of the point I made above, a lot of my projects won't be 100% Quantum code, mostly hybrid. 

## How To Run My Code

1. Refer to IBM's documentation on setting up Qiskit [here](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/en/guides).

2. After setting up Qiskit, you probably were required to create an IBM cloud account. In your dashboard, you need to fetch two things:
    * Your IBM API Key
    * Your IBM Cloud CRN 

3. After getting both, open up your VScode or Pycharm or whatever IDE your prefer, and make sure you set both of them as environment variables (or not if you're not going to post it onto github)

4. In the setup directory, run the IBMAPIKEY script. 

5. To verify everything works out, run the load_service script and your should get an output of all the quantum computers you have access to. 

6. Run any of my project codes and enjoy!

## Resources 

I will say that Quantum Computing is very different compared to regular computing/CS. So how ML/AI requires you to be good with stats/data science, QC requires you to be good at quantum mechanics...

I recommend that for CS or Data Science majors, learn quantum computing first before quantum mechanics. For Physics majors... well you probably are required to learn it anyway so that first then learn quantum computing.

* For Quantum Computing Math/Theory, I recommend FreeCodeCamp.org's video on [Quantum Computing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsbCSkvHhMo)
* For Quantum Programming, I recommend to learn it through IBM's [Qiskit Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@qiskit/featured). If you want to use a different Quantum programming language, it's a simple google away
* For Quantum Mechanics, I recommend Introduction to Quantum Mechanics by Griffiths.
